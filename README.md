## Project: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The objective of this website is to create a calender website. The user may use this to manage the their work day schedule. The below criteria was kept in mind when creating this scheduler:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Installation

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code can be downloaded via the Scheduler folder on my Github page. It can also be viewed by visiting the following URL: https://kristinaama.github.io/Scheduler/

## Usage

This work day scheduler is intended for easy viewing and navigation. The time blocks are colored to indicate the time frame the user has in their day. The grey blocks indicate scheduled events in the past, the red block indicates the current time block, and the green blocks indicate the future time blocks. Write an appointment in the designated time block and click the Save button. Events will be saved in that time frame, even if the page is refreshed.
